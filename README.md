## Inspiration

Karung gunis are an integral part of our Singapore lives. They help us recycle our used newspapers, magazines, old electrical appliances etc. Often taken for granted by many, they contribute immensely through recycling and saving our Earth's resources.

However, the income of karung gunis are often irregular, subjected to market forces such as the paper recycling vendors, fluctuating paper prices, weather, lousy customers. Some karung gunis also tried to spoil market through dipping paper into water to increase their weight (and value).

## What it does

Using the Hyperledger blockchain, we can track the process of paper recycling from the customers, to karung gunis, to vendors, thus ensuring price and quality consistency.

## How I built it

This project was built with Hyperledger blockchain, and Angular as frontend, for the National Blockchain Challenge 2019 hackathon.
